# üõ†Ô∏è Code Snippets
A Collection of My WordPress / WooCommerce Code Snippets.

## Overview

This repository contains my collection of WordPress code snippets that I‚Äôve created and gathered from my projects. It serves as a personal resource to quickly access and reuse code that I frequently use.

It started as a simple local folder to keep my snippets organized. By sharing these snippets on GitHub, I hope others can benefit from them as well.

## How to Use These Snippets

- **Browse** the snippets available in the repository.
- **Copy** the snippet you want to use.
- **Paste** it into the WordPress theme or plugin file, or use a **code snippets plugin** if you prefer not to modify theme files.
- **Customize** the snippet as needed for your project.
